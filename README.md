Hello!

Assignment 2 was an intoduction to allocating on the heap. The assignment was to make a dynamically sized array that would double when the maximum capacity was reached.

Assignment 3 was an introduction to linked lists, while assignment 4 built on top of that, with one of the functions detecting a loop in the list.

Assigment 5 was using stacks and queues to operate a restaurant.

Assignments 6 and 7 utilitized a binary search tree, including rotations.

Assignments 8 and 9 used graphs, with BFS and DFS used in each assignment, respectively.

The final project is a dungeon crawler-style game. It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the easiest path from the start to the end of the dungeon. The dungeon is read in as a hash table, but then converted into a graph. Each enemy has a priority queue, with the most damaging weapon at the top.
