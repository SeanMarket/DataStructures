Hello!

Assignment 2 was an intoduction to allocating on the heap. The assignment was to make a dynamically sized array that would double when the maximum capacity was reached.

Assignment 3 was an introduction to linked lists, while assignment 4 built on top of that, with one of the functions detecting a loop in the list.

Assigment 5 was using stacks and queues to operate a restaurant.

Assignments 6 and 7 utilitized a binary search tree, including rotations.

Assignments 8 and 9 used graphs, with BFS and DFS used in each assignment, respectively.

I am currently working on the final project, so I did not upload it to the repo. The project is building off of assignment 9 by using Dijkstra's algorithm, as well as heaps and priority queues.
