# CSCI 2270: Data Structures <br/> Dungeon Crawler Item Management

This project is a simple implementation of a dungeon crawler using C++ and three data structures: a Hash Table, Priority Queue, and Graph. Please read through the entire *CSCI2270_Spring25_Project.pdf* document for detailed instructions.

## Grading Policy

1. You are required to schedule a mandatory Interview Grading session with course staff. A sign-up sheet has been posted via a Canvas announcement. Interview Grading will be conducted between 4/28 and 5/1. Students who don’t sign up for their interview on time or who skip their interview will receive a 0.
2. Projects that do not compile will receive a max possible score of 50 and that assumes that the program features have been implemented.
   
## Submission Guidelines

1. Step 1 – INGInious will not be used for this assignment. You must submit/push your final solution to your GitHub repo by the due date. Submitting past 1159PM MDT on the due date will result in a 0 regardless of the reason. You are being given 2 weeks to complete this project. Start early.
2. Step 2 – Download a zipped version of your GitHub repository solution (.zip extension) and upload it to the Canvas Course Project dropbox by the due date.

## Disclaimer

1. Use of AI tools such as ChatGPT is not allowed.
2. Students are not allowed to share this code or make it public at any time, even after the course has completed.

## Interview Grading Policy

1. Come prepared by having your solution open and read to compile so that you can run through the menu options one by one. Also, you should have your GitHub page open.
2. Expect to answer a variety of questions about your code as well as conceptual questions pertaining to the respective data structures.
3. Your TA may show you a visual/diagram of a data structure and expect you to answer questions about it, such as where the items in the visual are in your source code/solution and how you implemented them. Therefore, you must be prepared to draw diagrams exhibiting that you understand your code.
4. You will not be allowed to read off of prepared notes.
5. Repeat interviews will not be given if you do not interview well. You will receive a 0 and it will be reported to the Honor Code Committee. In short, you must understand every line of code.
